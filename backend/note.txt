This FriendshipCard project is similar to BasicContactList project.

In Python best practice, 
its is better to have a separate virtual environment that is separate from the local machine.

we can do that by running:

`python -m venv venv`

to activate the virtual environment, do

`.\venv\Scripts\activate`

to deactivate active virtual environment, do

`deactivate`

use pip for package management.


rather than writing out requirements one by one, 

use 
`pip freeze > requirements.txt`
